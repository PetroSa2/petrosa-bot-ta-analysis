# HELP: CI/CD Pipeline Fixing Process
#
# 1. Run the local pipeline and all tests (e.g., `./scripts/local-pipeline.sh all` or `make test`).
# 2. Fix any errors locally until all checks pass.
# 3. Only commit and push changes when the local pipeline is green.
# 4. Check the GitHub Actions (GHA) CI/CD pipeline status after pushing.
# 5. If the GHA pipeline fails, repeat: fix errors locally, commit, and push until the pipeline passes.
# 6. Do NOT stop until the CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions is green.
# 7. No need to merge to main; just ensure the PR pipeline is green.
